        <h2>Maxims of Baloo</h2>

        <p>All that is told here happened some time before
            Mowgli was turned out of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or
            revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the
            days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle.
            The big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so
            quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as
            much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own
            pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat
            the Hunting Verse —‘Feet that make no noise; eyes that
            can see in the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their
            lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks
            of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena
            whom we hate.’ But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a
            great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black
            Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see
            how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head
            against a tree while Mowgli recited the day’s lesson to
            Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could
            swim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo,
            the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a rotten branch from a sound one; how
            to speak politely to the wild bees when he came upon a
            hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang
            the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday;
            and how to warn the water-snakes in the pools before he
            splashed down among them. None of the Jungle People
            like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at an
            intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers’
            Hunting Call, which must be repeated aloud till it is
            answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People hunts
            outside his own grounds. It means, translated, ‘Give me
            leave to hunt here because I am hungry.’ And the answer
            is, ‘Hunt then for food, but not for pleasure.’ </p>

        <p>All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn
            by heart, and he grew very tired of saying the same thing
            over a hundred times. But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one
            day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a
            temper, ‘A man’s cub is a man’s cub, and he must learn all
            the Law of the Jungle.’</p>
    
        <p>‘But think how small he is,’ said the Black Panther,
            who would have spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own
            way. ‘How can his little head carry all thy long talk?’ </p>

    <p>‘Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed?
            No. That is why I teach him these things, and that is why
            I hit him, very softly, when he forgets.’ 
            </p>

        <p>‘Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Ironfeet?’
            Bagheera grunted. ‘His face is all bruised today by
            thy— softness. Ugh.’</p>

    <h3>Better he should</h3>

        <p>‘Better he should be bruised from head to foot by me
            who love him than that he should come to harm through
            ignorance,’ Baloo answered very earnestly. ‘I am now
            teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that shall
            protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all
            that hunt on four feet, except his own pack. He can now
            claim protection, if he will only remember the words,
            from all in the jungle. Is not that worth a little beating?’ </p>

        <p>‘Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill the mancub.
            He is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon.
            But what are those Master Words? I am more likely to
            give help than to ask it’ —Bagheera stretched out one paw
            and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end
            of it—‘still I should like to know.’</p>

        <p>‘I will call Mowgli and he shall say them—if he will.
            Come, Little Brother!’ </p>

        <p>‘My head is ringing like a bee tree,’ said a sullen little
            voice over their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant, adding as he reached the
            ground: ‘I come for Bagheera and not for thee, fat old
            Baloo!’ </p>

        <p>‘That is all one to me,’ said Baloo, though he was hurt
            and grieved. ‘Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of
            the Jungle that I have taught thee this day.’ </p>

    <h4>Master words for</h4>    

         <p>‘Master Words for which people?’ said Mowgli,
            delighted to show off. ‘The jungle has many tongues. I
            know them all.’ </p>

        <p>"A little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera, they never thank their teacher. Not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank old Baloo for his teachings. Say the word for the Hunting-People, then--great scholar."</p>

        <p>"We be of one blood, ye and I," said Mowgli, giving the words the Bear accent which all the Hunting People use.</p>

        <p>"Good. Now for the birds."</p>

        <p>Mowgli repeated, with the Kite's whistle at the end of the sentence.</p>

    <h5>Now for the</h5>

        <p>‘Now for the Snake-People,’ said Bagheera. The answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and
                Mowgli kicked up his feet behind, clapped his hands
                together to applaud himself, and jumped on to Bagheera’s
                back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think
                of at Baloo. </p>

        <p>‘There—there! That was worth a little bruise,’ said the
                brown bear tenderly. ‘Some day thou wilt remember me.’
                Then he turned aside to tell Bagheera how he had begged
                the Master Words from Hathi the Wild Elephant, who
                knows all about these things, and how Hathi had taken
                Mowgli down to a pool to get the Snake Word from a
                water-snake, because Baloo could not pronounce it, and
                how Mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents
                in the jungle, because neither snake, bird, nor beast would
                hurt him.</p>

        <p>‘No one then is to be feared,’ Baloo wound up, patting
                his big furry stomach with pride. </p>

        <p>‘Except his own tribe,’ said Bagheera, under his breath;
                and then aloud to Mowgli, ‘Have a care for my ribs, Little
                Brother! What is all this dancing up and down?’ </p>

        <p>Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by
                pulling at Bagheera’s shoulder fur and kicking hard. When
                the two listened to him he was shouting at the top of his
                voice, ‘And so I shall have a tribe of my own, and lead
                them through the branches all day long.’
                ‘What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?’ said
                Bagheera. </p>

    <h6>Yes, and throw</h6>

        <p>‘Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,’
        Mowgli went on. ‘They have promised me this. Ah!’
        ‘Whoof!’ Baloo’s big paw scooped Mowgli off
        Bagheera’s back, and as the boy lay between the big forepaws
        he could see the Bear was angry. </p>

        <p>‘Mowgli,’ said Baloo, ‘thou hast been talking with the
        Bandar-log—the Monkey People.’
        Mowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was
        angry too, and Bagheera’s eyes were as hard as jade stones. </p>
        
        <p>‘Thou hast been with the Monkey People—the gray
                apes—the people without a law—the eaters of everything.
                That is great shame.’
                ‘When Baloo hurt my head,’ said Mowgli (he was still
                on his back), ‘I went away, and the gray apes came down
                from the trees and had pity on me. No one else cared.’ He
                snuffled a little. </p>

        <p>‘The pity of the Monkey People!’ Baloo snorted. ‘The
                stillness of the mountain stream! The cool of the summer
                sun! And then, man-cub?’ </p>

        <p>‘And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant
                things to eat, and they—they carried me in their arms up
                to the top of the trees and said I was their blood brother
                except that I had no tail, and should be their leader some
                day.’ </p>
